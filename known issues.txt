This document contains some issues related to the current SLab distribution

Issues of SLab v1.3 release

( ) The board communication locks with a "Reading Board Data" message
    This is due to changes in the Pyserial interface and only affects Linux
    Test if the following code connects with the board:
       >>> import slab
       >>> slab.linux = False
       >>> slab.connect()
     If the code works, the permanent solution is to edit the slab.py file 
     and add a line, at the end that contanins
       linux = False
