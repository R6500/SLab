# SLab
Small Lab project for low buget on hands electronics learning

SLab is composed on three main components:

1) Hardware
    One low cost demonstration board that include, at least, two DACs and four ADC inputs
    Some electronics, at least 6 opamps, to provide some buffering
    
2) Software
    Two software packages:
    
       a) Firmware code to be downloaded on the demonstration board
       
       b) Python code that interacts with the board
       
3) Documentation
    Documentation is also divided in two kind of documents
    
       a) SLab setup and reference documentation
            This documentation explains how to use the SLab system
            
       b) Electronics tutorials
            This documents teach electronics by hands-on circuit build and measurements
            
Information about this projects will be posted on my two blogs:

The full, current 1.2 version, of SLab is included in the "SLab v1.2 (11-02-2018).zip" file
